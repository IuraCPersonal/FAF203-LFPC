# **Theme: LL1 and Simple precedence parsing**

### Laboratory Tasks:

1. For the given grammar build the matrix of simple precedence, analyze the given
   string and construct the derivation tree.
2. For the given grammar build the LL(1) parse table, analyze the given string and
   construct the derivation tree.
3. For the tasks from 1 and 2 point realize the program that implement the respectively
   algorithms of syntactic analysis.
