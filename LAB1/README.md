# Theme: Regular or context free grammar V-4

## Laboratory tasks:

1. For the formal grammar `G=(VN, VT, P, S)` need be obtained five strings, that belong to the
language **L(G)**, that is generated by this grammar. The length of strings must be no lesser than
the number of characters from the alphabet VN+2.

2. For each string build the **noninverted (derivation) tree** and **derivation table**.

3. Convert regular grammar to **Finite Automaton (FA)**.

4. Determine the grammar type by the **Chromsky classification**.
